<h1> Five Helpful Facts About Copyright Law </h1>

<h1> <a href="https://www.themyerslg.com/blog/2016/09/7-must-know-facts-about-u-s-copyright-law/"> 1. </a> </h1>
		<p> A copyright grants you many exclusive rights including: creating derivative works based on the work, distributing copies of the work, and publicly displaying the work.  </p>
		<br>
		<br>
<h1> 2. </h1>
		<p> For works created on or after January 1, 1978 the duration of a copyright lasts from the moment of its creation and lasts for the author’s life plus an additional 70 years. </p>
		<br>
		<br>
<h1> 3. </h1>
		<p> There are a few things that even copyright law can’t protect: ideas, fashion designs, methods, and systems. </p>
		<br>
		<br>
<h1> 4. </h1>
		<p> Myth: Do not assume that a work is in the public domain or that a work is not protected because a copyright symbol is not shown. You can look up registered works on the Copyright Office website to determine whether or not you may use the work. </p>
		<br>
		<br>
<h1> <a href="https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/8-basic-facts-every-musician-should-know-about-copyright-law"> 5. </a> </h1>
		<p> Work does not have to be published anywhere in order to be copyrighted; even unpublished works are eligible for copyright protection. </p>
		<br>
		<br>
<h2> Fun Fact: </h2>
		<p> Generally sound recordings are copyrighted separately from the copyright of a musical composition as they are not considered the same work under copyright law. </p>
